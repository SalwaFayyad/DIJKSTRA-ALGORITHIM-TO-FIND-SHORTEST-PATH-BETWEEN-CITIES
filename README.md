# Shortest-Path-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Data Structure project to find the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra's algorithim.
## Description
This project involves implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between two cities. The program reads data from a provided file, "cities.txt," and constructs a graph based on this information. Users can input a source city and a destination city, after which the program computes the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. The shortest path is then displayed, detailing the route between the two cities, including the distance between each pair of cities and the total shortest cost. Additionally, users have the option to save this information to a file named "shortest_path.txt" before exiting the program.
## Implementation Details
To implement this project, the following steps can be followed:
1. Read the data from the file "cities.txt" and construct a graph representing the cities and the roads connecting them.
2. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from a given source city to all other cities in the graph. This involves maintaining a priority queue to efficiently select the next city with the shortest distance.
3. Create a menu-driven interface with the following options:

- Option 1: Load cities - Reads the file and constructs the graph.
- Option 2: Enter source city - Allows the user to input the source city and computes the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Option 3: Enter destination city - Prints the full route of the shortest path, including the distance between each pair of cities and the total shortest cost.
- Option 4: Exit - Prints the information of step 3 to a file called "shortest_path.txt" and exits the
