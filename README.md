# Shortest-Path-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Data Structure project to find the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra's algorithim.
## Description
This program is designed to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for determining the shortest path between two points within a graph representing cities. The input file, "segments.txt," contains pertinent information regarding the roads linking cities and towns, including the respective distances. The program constructs a graph based on this data, enabling users to identify the shortest route between any two specified cities.
## Implementation Details
- Reads the input file "segments.txt" and loads the road data.
- Constructs a graph representing the cities and towns with roads as edges.
- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two input points.
- Prints the route of the shortest distance to a file named "route.txt".
- Allows the user to perform multiple shortest path calculations for different pairs of cities/towns.
- Provides a menu-driven interface for ease of use.
## Usage
- Compile the program.
- Run the executable.
- Choose the option to read the input file.
- Enter two points to compute the shortest path between them.
- Optionally, choose to save the shortest path to a file.
- Repeat steps 4-5 for different pairs of cities/towns.
- Choose the option to exit the program when finished.
